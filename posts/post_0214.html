        <p>To understand how quantum computer works, fundamental knowledge on the quantum mechanis is preferred.</p>
        <p>Excerpt from the Lecture: The uncertainty principle "protects" quantum mechanis. Heisenberg recogized that if were possible to measure the moment and the positon simultaneuouly with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse. So he proposed that it must be impossible. Then People sat down and tried to figure out ways of doing it, and nobody could figure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything- a screen, an electron, a billard ball, anything - with any greater accuracy. Quantum mechanis maintains its periolous but still correct existence.</p>
