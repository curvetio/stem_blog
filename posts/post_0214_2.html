        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at the microscopic scale, where classical physics no longer applies. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, superposition, and quantum entanglement.</p>
        
        <h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
        <p>One of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is wave-particle duality, which states that particles such as electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.</p>
        <p>The famous de Broglie relation is given by:</p>
        <p>\[ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \]</p>
        <p>where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>\( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the particle.</li>
            <li>\( h \) is Planck's constant.</li>
            <li>\( p \) is the momentum of the particle.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Superposition Principle</h2>
        <p>In quantum mechanics, a system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. This is represented mathematically by a linear combination of quantum states:</p>
        <p>\[ |\psi\rangle = c_1 |\psi_1\rangle + c_2 |\psi_2\rangle \]</p>
        <p>where \( |\psi\rangle \) is the overall quantum state and \( c_1, c_2 \) are complex coefficients.</p>
        
        <h2>Quantum Entanglement</h2>
        <p>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of distance.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Quantum behavior challenges our classical intuition and has profound implications for technology, including quantum computing and cryptography.</p>
